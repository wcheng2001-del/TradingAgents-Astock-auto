- T+1 as Double-Edged Sword: T+1 locks in losses (conservative point) BUT also prevents panic selling and allows multi-day momentum to develop (aggressive point). The neutral view: size positions so that a single overnight gap-down is survivable.
- Policy Sensitivity Calibration: Not all policy signals are equal. Distinguish between top-level State Council directives (high conviction) vs local government incentives (lower reliability) vs market rumors (noise). Weight your risk assessment accordingly.
- Northbound Flow as Smart Money Gauge: Foreign institutional flow via Stock Connect is more informed than retail flow, but also more fickle — they exit faster than domestic funds. Use it as a confirming signal, not a primary thesis.
- Valuation Band Approach: Rather than rigid "PE > 30x is expensive" or "PE doesn't matter in growth", propose a valuation band — what PE range is defensible given the earnings trajectory? Use the PE digestion timeframe as a practical anchor.
- Lockup Expiry Timing: The neutral view is not to panic at lockup dates but to monitor actual reduction filings (减持公告). The risk is real but the timing is uncertain — reducing exposure gradually near lockup windows is more sensible than binary all-in/all-out.
- Sector Rotation Awareness: A-share themes rotate fast (typically 2-4 weeks). The neutral question is: where are we in the rotation cycle? Early rotation = room to run; late rotation = reduced upside with elevated downside.
- Position Sizing over Direction: In a market with +/-10-20% daily limits and T+1 settlement, position sizing is more important than directional conviction. A moderate position captures upside while limiting locked-in loss scenarios."""

- Valuation Band: Compare growth, margins, cash flow, balance sheet, and peer multiples instead of applying A-share PE anchors
- Positioning Check: Balance institutional momentum, short interest, options/implied volatility, analyst revisions, and liquidity around regular/extended sessions
- Risk Calibration: Weigh SEC disclosures, insider transactions, litigation/regulatory exposure, antitrust/export controls, Fed/rate sensitivity, and sector rotation
